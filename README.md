## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Upload the firmware

Upload the code to your ESP32 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

### 2. Initial Configuration

- Press and hold the button for more than 5 seconds ‚Äî the device will enter AP mode.
1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network named `ESP32-SinricProWol` with password `12345678`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1
3. Fill in the required configuration:
   - Wi-Fi credentials (2.4GHz networks only)
   - SinricPro details (App Key, App Secret, Device ID)
   - PC MAC address
   - Preferred operation mode and options
4. Click "Save" and the device will restart

### 3. SinricPro Setup

1. Create an account at [SinricPro](https://sinric.pro)
2. Add a new device (type: Switch)
3. Copy the App Key, App Secret, and Device ID to the ESP32 configuration
4. Link your SinricPro account with Google Home or Amazon Alexa

## üíª PC Configuration

To enable Wake-on-LAN on your PC:
- Google it ‚Äî it's free.

## üéÆ Usage

### Voice Commands

- "Hey Google, turn on [device name]" or "Alexa, turn on [device name]"

### Physical Control

- **Short press** the button to send a Wake-on-LAN packet
- **Long press** (5+ seconds) to enter configuration mode

## üîÑ Configuration Mode

You can re-enter configuration mode anytime by:
1. Long-pressing the physical button for more than 5 seconds
2. Connecting to `ESP32-SinricProWol` Wi-Fi network
3. Navigating to http://192.168.4.1 in your browser

## üìù Operation Modes

- **Allow Both**: Control via SinricPro (voice commands) and physical button
- **SinricPro Only**: Control via SinricPro only
- **Physical Button Only**: Control via physical button only

## üö® Troubleshooting

### LED Indicators

- **Blinking Red**: Wi-Fi connection issue
- **Solid Red**: Sending WOL packet
- **Solid Green**: Connected successfully
- **Solid Blue**: In configuration mode or performing OTA update
- **Rainbow Effect**: Normal operation (when RGB LED is enabled)

### Common Issues

- **PC won't wake up**: Check BIOS and OS WOL settings, verify MAC address
- **Can't connect to Wi-Fi**: Ensure you're using a 2.4GHz network
- **Voice commands not working**: Check SinricPro account linking with Google Home/Alexa

## üîÑ Updates

The device supports OTA (Over-The-Air) updates through the SinricPro platform, but only use this if you know what you're doing!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

You can customize the following parameters in the code:
- PIN assignments
- Buzzer duration
- Logic code (only do this if you know what you're doing)
